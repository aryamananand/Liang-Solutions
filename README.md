# Liang-Solution
My solutions to some problems from Daniel Liang. 

Most solutions are non-optimised, but simple, intuitive solutions. 

Although these programs should work, _I hold no responsibility on the correctness of these problems_. 

Notes: 
- My teacher tells me that code under 25000 lines of code doesn't require strict adherence to OOP, Classes, Inheritance, and such practices. I have therefore not heavily used these concepts.
- I also don't follow the strict pep8 (or any such similar-) formatting regulations.


Thanks, and good luck with your Python!
