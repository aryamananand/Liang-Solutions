# Liang-Solution
My solutions to some problems from Daniel Liang. 

Most solutions are non-optimised, but simple, intuitive solutions. I, however, hold no responsibility on the correctness of these problemsvvvvvv, although they should work. 

Notes: My teacher tells me that code under 25000 lines of code doesn't require strict adherence to OOP, Classes, Inheritance, and such practices. I have therefore not heavily used these concepts.
